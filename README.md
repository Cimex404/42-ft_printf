#   ft_printf 42

ft_printf is a 42 project that teaches about variable-length function calls.
This project is a great asset for the later project as it is much simpler and more versatile than the write function.

This project creates a static library called "ft_printf.a" from the source files. This static library can be
compiled into other projects to use the ft_printf function in other projects as well.

Simply run the "make" command on the terminal to compile the project into the static library.
In this implementation, the compiler will also create an executable called "ft_printf", that will showcase all
possible conversions the library is capable of. To test it, simply run ./ft_printf. If you want to run further
tests, simply modify "main.c" with code editor of your choice.
